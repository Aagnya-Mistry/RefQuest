RIL Q1 Results: What to expect?
According to analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities (KIE), RIL could post a 29% year-on-year (YoY) jump in Q1 PAT to ₹19,517 crore, boosted by one-off gains of ~ ₹9000 crore (post-tax) on Asian Paints stake sale. However, its net sales could see a dip of 1% YoY to ₹2,29,475.7 crore as against ₹2,31,784 crore in the Q1 FY25 quarter.

"We expect RIL’s consolidated EBITDA to rise by 15.4% YoY, with a 19-20% yoy increase for O2C, digital and retail, offset by weak E&P," KIE said.

Domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial Services anticipates a 32% jump in PAT to nearly ₹20,000 crore, while it sees a strong growth in Q1 revenue to ₹266100 crore, a growth of 15%.

"Clarity on ₹75000 crore announcements in the new energy business, growth in Retail store additions, and any pricing action in Telecom are the key monitorables," as per the brokerage.

RIL share price trend
After remaining in a consolidation mode for quite some time, RIL share price has seen a healthy rebound this year so far, recording a year-to-date gain of 22% even as it remains 5% lower over one year.

This recent rally has pushed the Mukesh Ambani-led company's market capitalisation past the ₹20 lakh crore mark, further cementing its position as India's biggest company.
